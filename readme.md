## Project Overview
This project is divided into two major parts. In the first part, you will conduct an exploratory data analysis on a dataset Ford GoBike System Data. I will use Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships. The analysis in this part should be structured, going from simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships.

In the second part, I will take my main findings from my exploration and convey them to others through an explanatory analysis. To this end, I will create a slide deck that leverages polished, explanatory visualizations to communicate my results.

## Summary of Findings

 >   The amount of people who are subscribers are more than regular customers, but also we found out the average time spending for regular customers are higher than the subscribers. The avg time people spending in using bikes in Saturday & Sunday are higher rather than other days. Also the records shows that the avg minutes in September , August and July are higher than other months. In tuesday and wednesday are the top in amount of using bikes, the amount of customer in saturday & sunday are nearly to the subscribers with slightly different. October has the highest amounts of records coming after that September. June get's the minimum level of usage.The avg duration time for regular customars are higher in june and july, coming after that august and september. for subscribers almost all months are close to each either. Also the results shows that the people who start use the bikes system at 03:00 hour has the maximum avg duration for both types of people Customers and subscribers which mean  people use the system at this time are usually  spending more time than others .



## Key Insights for Presentation

>  The avg duration time for regular customars are higher in june and july, coming after that august and september. for subscribers almost all months are close to each either. The relationship shows that the people who start use the bikes system at 03:00 hour has the maximum avg duration for both types of people Customers and subscribers. The most interesting relationship we found is the last point which shows most people whos start using the bike's system at 3:00, they have the highest avg duration time for both types of people. in general, between 1:00 to 5:00 is the peaked times that people have high avg duration time if they take a bike in these time.
